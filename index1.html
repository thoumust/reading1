	<p>Indigenous peoples first attempted to reach out to the international community as early as 1923 when Chief Deskaheh, the speaker of the Iroquois Confederacy Council, tried to get the League of Nations to address the Iroquois' dispute with Canada. This was followed in 1925 by W.T. Ratana, a Maori leader who wanted to bring the New Zealand government's violations against the Waitangi Treaty with the League of Nations. Although the Maoris failed to get an audience with the League, their visits were assertions that indigenous peoples are subjects of international law. With the UN's establishment in 1945 and human rights being the key foundational element of its Charter, the justification for indigenous peoples' engagement with the UN was strengthened.

Decolonization was one of the objectives of the UN. However, because of the "blue water thesis" that only colonies overseas can be subjected to decolonization procedures, the indigenous peoples in independent countries were considered outside of it, despite their being victims of colonization. The General Assembly did not totally ignore this reality and in 1949, issued a resolution asking the Economic and Social Council to study the "social problem of the aboriginal populations and other under-developed social groups of the American Continent." Unfortunately, this never materialized as no affected state was interested in implementing the recommendation."

The Organization of American States General Assembly in 1948 also took initial steps to recognize that indigenous peoples are special subjects of international concern. Article 39 of the Inter-American Charter of Social Guarantees provided that states in the Inter-American System should take "necessary measures" to protect indigenous peoples' lives and property, "defending them from extermination, sheltering them from oppression and exploitation" (Anaya &Williams. 2001: 33).

 

ILO Conventions 107 and 169

The International Labor Organization (ILO), which predated the UN, was the first multilateral body to look at the situation of indigenous peoples. In 1921, it carried out studies on the situation of indigenous workers that showed how indigenous peoples were victims of forced recruitment and forced labor, not to speak of slave-like labor practices. This led to the establishment of its Committee of Experts on Native Labour in 1926, which came up with conventions and recommendations on forced labor, and a Second Committee of Experts on Indigenous Labour in 1951.

The ILO was also the first multilateral body that adopted a Convention addressing indigenous peoples. This was Convention No. 107Concerning the Protection and Integration of Indigenous and Other Tribal and Semi-Tribal Populations in Independent Countries adopted on June 26, 1957.

Unfortunately, the approach it took was paternalistic and assimilationist, and its solution to the indigenous problematique was to integrate IPs into the dominant society and within the dominant development model. The Convention states:

Considering that there exist in various independent countries indigenous and other tribal and semi-tribal populations which are not yet integrated into the national community and whose social, economic or cultural situation hinders them from benefiting fully from the rights and advantages enjoyed by other elements of the population ... [governments shall have the primary responsibility for developing coordinated and systematic action for the protection of the population concerned and their progressive integration into the life of their respective countries ... (ILO, 1957)

Indigenous experts brought together by ILO at a Meeting of Experts in 1986 strongly criticized the Convention, recommending its revision as its assimilationist framework "meant the extinction of ways of life which are different from that of the dominant society." Assimilation or integration is the logical consequence of a development paradigm which does not respect cultural diversity. The experts invoked the report of Martinez Cobo, Special Rapporteur on situation of discrimination against indigenous populations. It says "the policies of pluralism, self-sufficiency, self-management and ethnodevelopment appeared to be those which would give indigenous populations the best possibilities and means of participating directly in the formulation and implementation of official policies" (Anaya, 2004: 58).

The International Labor Conference, the ILO's highest decision making body, initiated the process of revising Convention No. 107 in 1988 and 1989. This was done with almost no participation of indigenous peoples as they are not part of the ILO tripartite system consisting of states,labor unions and employers. Before the year ended in 1989, the Conference adopted Convention No. 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. As this was meant to remove the assimilationist aspects of the previous Convention, it had to reiterate in several preambular and operative paragraphs that it recognizes the aspirations and rights of indigenous peoples to exercise control over their own ways of life and economic development. Nineteen countries had ratified this Convention as of 2007.

It instructs governments to establish means and provide resources for the full development of indigenous peoples' institutions and initiatives (Article 6). Article 7 also reiterates the right of indigenous peoples to control their social, economic and cultural development:
The peoples concerned shall have the right to decide their own priorities for the process of development as it affects their lives. beliefs. and institutions and spiritual well-being and the lands they occupy or otherwise use and to exercise control. to the extent possible. over their own economic. social and cultural development. In addition, they shall participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programs for national and regional development which may affect them directly.
 

The improvement of the conditions of life and work and levels of health and education of the peoples concerned, with their participation and co-operation, shall be a matter of priority in plans for the overall economic development of areas they inhabit. Special projects for development of the areas in question shall also be designed as to promote such improvement.
 

Governments shall ensure that, whenever appropriate, studies are carried out in cooperation with the peoples concerned, to assess the social, spiritual, cultural and environmental impact on them of planned development activities. The results of these studies shall be considered as fundamental criteria for the implementation of these activities.
 

The Convention further recognizes that indigenous peoples have rights to own lands they traditionally occupy and to use those which they do not exclusively occupy but still use for subsistence and other traditional activities (Article 14). It also ensures the continued practice of indigenous livelihoods like pastoralism, hunting and gathering, shifting cultivation and handicraft development, especially as these form part of their cultures and link with their right to their natural resources ( 14, 15,23).
 

UN Development Decades

The UN declared the First Development Decade (1960 – 1970), but despite the growing evidence that rapid economic growth is accompanied by increasing inequalities, it still pursued the same model of development. A five percent target minimum economic growth was set for the underdeveloped world. When the Decade ended, the growth rate of developed countries accelerated but the gap between the per capita incomes of underdeveloped and developed countries widened. Two-thirds of the world's population living in underdeveloped countries still had less than one-sixth of the world's income. Recognizing the need to ensure a balance between economic and social development, the Decade Programme proposed that one percent of developed countries' incomes should go to underdeveloped nations in the form of international aid and financial assistance. Although this was lowered to 0.7 percent in subsequent Decades, these targets sadly were not met except by a very few countries. During this period, massive infrastructures like highways and mega-hydroelectric dams were built in indigenous territories in Latin America, Asia and Africa. The entry of mining, logging, and oil and gas corporations into indigenous territories also led to their forcible displacement and militarization of their communities.

The merging of economic and social development was only proposed in the Second Development Decade (1970-1980), which was affirmed by the International Development Strategy proclaimed on October 24, 1970. This integration favors indigenous peoples as most development programs then stressed quantitative, material and economic aspects of development and ignored its social and cultural aspects.

In response xxx a UNEP-UNCTAD (UN Conference on Trade and Development) Symposium held in October 1974 resulted in the Declaration of Cocoyoc, which states that the aim of development is not to develop things but to develop man. Subsequently ILO developed its Basic Needs Approach, which had the goal of establishing a minimum standard of living. At the third UNCTAD meeting in 1972, the issue of rights was brought into the development discourse with the assertion by governments in the South or underdeveloped world that they have the right to development. (Gready& Ensor, 2005: 18).

The UNESCO, in turn, formulated the concept of endogenous development which Esteva described:

For some time, this conception won more acceptance than all the others. It seemed clearly heretical, openly contradicting the conventional wisdom. Emerging from a rigorous critique of the hypothesis of development in ‘stages' (Rostow), the thesis of endogenous development, rejected the necessity or possibility - let alone suitability - of mechanically imitating industrial societies. Instead, it proposed taking due account of the particularities of each nation.

This radical but sensible idea, however, did not prosper because it posed a serious challenge to the dominant development paradigm, which is pushed as the single economic and cultural model for the world. A truly endogenous development allows for diverse cultures to exist and for indigenous economic and social systems to thrive. The architects and beneficiaries of the dominant development model would find it hard to support something which goes against their own models and interests.

The other debate taking place at the same time revolved around development economics. The notion of underdevelopment and the standards of modernity, progress and development, which were measured only through the yardstick of Western progress, were questioned. Underdevelopment which was described in terms of low productivity, lack of capital and inadequate industrialization was critiqued," especially as it is was generally applied to the South or the Third World. Within the South it was the indigenous peoples who were considered the
backward and underdeveloped sectors. Tragically, modernity and development as conceptualized by the North was eventually accepted by newly independent nation-states as their own agenda.

 

 

 

UN Declaration on Right to Development

Within the Second Development Decade, the right to development was " ... raised by developing countries as their claim for distributional equity in the international political economy of development.” The UN Declaration on the Right to Development (RTD), which was finally adopted in 1986, was the result of the assertion by underdeveloped countries that their right to develop has to be acknowledged and supported by the international community. Stephen Marks, an expert on the issue, further explained the agenda of developing countries, particularly the most active members of the Non-Aligned Movement who call themselves the "Like-Minded Group." Their interests are to use the R TD to reduce inequities of international trade, the negative impacts of globalization, differential access to technology, the crushing debt burden, and similar factors they see as detrimental to the enjoyment of human rights and development."

At the first UNCTAD meeting in 1964 these countries stated strongly that sovereignty is nothing if the world's economic resources remain concentrated in the hands of the former colonizers. Gaining their independence was important but the next step should be the restructuring of the global economic system to redistribute control over economic resources through a New International Economic Order (NIEO). To strengthen the NIEO agenda, developing countries convinced the Commission on Human Rights to deal with the issue of the right to development, resulting in two resolutions (Res. 411977 and 511979), which affirmed that the right to development is a human right. In 1979 the General Assembly passed Resolution 34/46 stating that the right to development is "a human right and that equality of opportunity is as much a prerogative of nations and of individuals within nations."

To further address the raging debates on this issue, the Commission on Human Rights asked the Secretary General to conduct a study on the international aspects of the right to development. The report came out in 1979 and stated that:

the central purpose of development is the realization of the potentialities of the human person in harmony with the community; the human person is the subject not the object of development; both material and non-material needs must be satisfied; respect for human rights is fundamental; the opportunity for full participation must be accorded; the principles of equality and non-discrimination must be respected; and a degree of individual and collective self-reliance must be achieved.

Some developed countries led by the United States strongly opposed the idea of a declaration on the right to development. The Cold War politics, which split the unity of civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, still largely influenced these arguments. In fact up to now, a divide remains between those who regard economic, social and cultural rights as essential human rights and those who do not accept it.

As no agreement could be reached on a draft, the Chair of the Working Group drafting a declaration on the right to development brought his own version before the General Assembly in 1986. This was passed through a vote of 146 in favor and one against (US) it, with eight abstentions. The developed countries were not all united against it, as Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands and New Zealand voted in favor of the Declaration.

Article 1 of the Declaration explicitly states that the right to development is an inalienable human right, and this implies the full realization of the right of peoples to self-determination, including the inalienable right to full sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources. After its adoption, a Working Group of Governmental Experts was established to discuss concrete recommendations on how it should be implemented. Since agreements could not be reached even after three session, the UN Commission on Human Rights requested then UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to organize a global consultation on the realization of the right to development. This took place in Geneva in January 1990 with the participation of experts, UN programs and agencies, 50 representatives of States, NGOs and a handful of indigenous representatives. This was the first time indigenous peoples had been invited to a process related to the Declaration on the Rights to Development. The consultation resulted in a report which identified the obstacles to the realization of human rights" and refined the concept of participation in human rights law."

After more than 10 years of existence, however, not much was seen by way of implementation of the Declaration to the Right to Development. Thus, the Commission on Human Rights set up a follow-up mechanism that included establishment of an open-ended working group (OEWG) and appointment of an independent expert. The expert's mandate is to present to the OEWG on RTD a study on the current state of progress in the implementation of the right of development as elaborated in the Declaration. (CHR resolution 1998172) Subsequently General Assembly resolution 541175 of 17 December 1999 called on the independent expert to submit comprehensive reports at its 51st Session on effects of poverty, structural adjustment, globalization, financial and trade liberalization and deregulation on the prospects of the enjoyment of the right of development in developing countries.

Arjun Sengupta, the Independent Expert on the Right to Development, came up with a series of reports which elaborated in more detail the concept of the right to development, recommendations on how to operationalize it, and the impacts of poverty and of globalization on the right to development, among others. In his first report he explained that the Declaration on the Right to Development succeeded in bringing back the concept of integrated and indivisible human rights. He said "in effect the right to development emerged as a human right which integrated economic, social, and cultural rights with civil and political rights in the manner envisaged at the beginning of the post-World War II human rights movement." The right to development, as a "universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights," was affirmed by the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights (1993).

Sengupta summarized the Declaration's main propositions:

a) The right to development is a human right.
 

The human right to development is a right to a particular process of development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized - which means that it combines all the rights enshrined in both the covenants and each of the rights has to be exercised with freedom.
 

c) The meaning of exercising these rights consistently with freedom implies free, effective and full participation of all the individuals concerned in the decision-making and the implementation of the process. Therefore, the process must be transparent and accountable, individuals must have the equal opportunity of access to the resources for development and receive fair distribution of the benefits of development (and income).
 

d) Finally, the right confers unequivocal obligation on duty-holders: individuals in the community, states at the national level, and states at the international level. National states have the responsibility to help realize the process of development through appropriate development policies. Other states and international agencies have the obligation to cooperate with the national states to facilitate the process of development.
 

While this Declaration framework is dominantly statist, it can still be used as a building block to strengthen and operationalize indigenous peoples' self-determined development. Indigenous peoples are hardly mentioned in the reports of the Working Group and the Independent Expert, but the Declaration affirms that the right to development is an integral and indivisible part of civil, political, social, cultural and economic rights, and stresses it is both a collective and individual right. The analysis of obstacles, such as globalization, debt burden, unequal trade agreements, financial and trade liberalization, is crucial in further understanding why development remains elusive for most peoples, including indigenous peoples.

Furthermore, the emphasis on the primacy of participation and the creation of appropriate development policies resonates with our assertion of our right to freely determine our economic, social and cultural development. Equity and social justice are also identified as key objectives of development, and not just economic growth. Through the years, reports by the Open-ended Working Group and Independent Expert have elaborated what the right to development is and how it relates to human development and the human-rights based approach to development. Legal scholars have come up with their own independent analysis on the consistency of the right to development with existing international human rights law.

A glaring gap in the reports and some legal commentaries, however, is again the invisibility of indigenous peoples. The OEWG Chairman's conclusions in the 2001 session are among the rare ones that mention indigenous peoples. Under the section on national actions, he affirmed the " ... need for special attention to persons belonging to minorities, whether national, ethnic, religious or linguistic, as well as to vulnerable groups, such as indigenous people, Roma, migrants ... "

The story of the Declaration on the Right to Development shows how indigenous peoples are invisible in the radar screens of most countries, whether developed or developing. We are referred to only in terms of our vulnerabilities and not the positive contributions we can offer to make development more socially just and culturally appropriate. While those of us from developing countries can sympathize with the efforts of their governments to assert their right to develop, we regret the strong statist underpinnings of this process and its end product. Another problem is their pursuit of the same dominant development model, which is one of the root causes of our further marginalization. This is what pushed us to assert our right to self-determination and to elaborate our own concept of self-determined development, using whatever we find useful from the results of the work and processes within the UN system. This paper treated this Declaration at great length, in spite of the fact that it barely refers to indigenous peoples to illustrate the challenges which indigenous peoples face in this debate.

 

Indigenous peoples' struggles for basic human rights, further engagements with UN

To address the hegemonic developmentalist wave or the dominant development paradigm, indigenous peoples responded in diverse ways. In Latin America the indigenous peoples took two tracks: one was to fight against it, and another used some of its policies and programs to promote their interests. The second track adopted agrarian reform, which was the political agenda of the peoples' movements. Indigenous peoples in the Andean regions of Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru as well as those from Guatemala and Mexico created or joined peasant cooperatives, unions, Basic Christian Communities and political parties. Many self-identified as campesino or peasants and not as indigenous peoples.

Those who opted to fight participated in armed revolutionary movements like URNG in Guatemala, Shining Path in Peru and at the turn of the millennium, the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico. The participation of indigenous peoples in armed movements is an expression of resistance against their marginalization. Unfortunately, in most instances their cause was subsumed into the class struggle, which made their identity and issues invisible. Nevertheless, because these revolutionary movements needed to generate support not only within the country but internationally, indigenous peoples who were part of these linked with other indigenous formations.

In Asia, among the indigenous peoples who armed themselves to fight against destructive development projects were the Igorot in the Philippines' Cordillera region; Jumma peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts; Naga and Mizo peoples of Northeast India; and the Karen, Shan and Chin in Burma. Formations are usually built along tribal lines, but when indigenous peoples are confronted with projects that impact across physical and tribal boundaries, the logical recourse are pan-tribal formations such as in the Philippines where a pan Cordillera-wide indigenous peoples' movement was born. National and regional formations" were also developed which engaged with the United Nations.

The indigenous peoples in developed countries either negotiated treaties with the State or filed legal suits against it, especially if it breached earlier treaty agreements. They brought complaints before the various UN Treaty Bodies, the most popular being the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and the Human Rights Committee (HRC). At the regional level they also used the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

Spaces provided by the United Nations which allowed for the participation of indigenous representatives helped to strengthen the global indigenous peoples' movement. The first was the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations, which saw an increasing participation of indigenous representatives since its establishment in 1982. This came about as a result of various UN and UN-related processes initiated by sympathetic UN staff, representatives of indigenous peoples, NGOs and States.

In 1971 the UN Economic and Social Council authorized the UN Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to undertake a study on the "Problem of Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations. The appointed Special Rapporteur, Martinez Cobo, came up with a series of partial reports between 1981-83, and the final paper containing the Conclusions and Recommendations was released in 1986. This report, popularly known as the Martinez Cobo Study, became the major UN reference document on indigenous peoples. The process set a precedent for other UN agencies or bodies also to support further studies or organize processes on indigenous peoples within the purview of their specific mandates.

Even before the Martinez-Cobo report was completed, the NGO Subcommittee on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Apartheid, and Decolonization held the "International NGO Conference on Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations in the Americas" in Geneva on 20-23 September 1977. Of around 400 persons who participated, a fourth or 100 were delegates of 60 indigenous nations and peoples from 15 countries in the Americas. Observers from 38-member states of the UN took part as well as UN agencies like UNESCO and ILO.

This historic conference approved the "Declaration of Principles for the Defense of Indigenous Nations and Peoples of the Western Hemisphere" and several resolutions including the call on the UN to set up a Working Group on Indigenous Populations. This conference, through its Economic Commission, gave a scathing critique of development and the role of multinational corporations:

To accommodate the increasing demand for materials and resources and the inherent profit quest, the multinational corporations have accelerated development and exploitation of native peoples and resources. A key force in this process in Latin America is the U.S. economic development and military aid. This exploitation is imminent due to the significance of native resources. In the U.S. alone, native lands include approximately 30 percent of all coal reserves, 90 percent of all uranium reserves and 50 percent of overall energy reserves. Indian lands in the U.S. have produced over 2.7 billion dollars.

Its Social and Cultural Commission elaborated the links between economic exploitation and indigenous culture. The destruction of indigenous cultures in the Americas is historically inseparable from the considerations which motivated and which still motivate the criminal acts of the European colonizers, the primary consideration being human exploitation and the greed for land and cheap labour. To destroy a culture is to destroy the basis for an autonomous society able to defend the interests of its members. It is noteworthy that this Commission has had great difficulty in isolating the destruction of culture from other acts of genocide, and it is necessary to constantly bear in mind the links existing between these phenomena. The pattern of cultural aggression and destructive cultural penetration may be said to begin at the point of departure for the culture of the Indians, i.e., their natural environment. The removal of Indians from their traditional homes, the physical corruption of their ceremonial grounds, the industrial pollution of their natural habitat, all render impossible the continuation of culture, not only because its physical basis is destroyed but because such acts do violence to the system of values possessed by the Indians.

Another important conference was the "Conference of Specialists on Ethnocide and Ethnodevelopment in Latin America" organized by UNESCO in 1981. It issued a Declaration proclaiming that "ethno-development is an alienable right of Indian groups" and affirming their "inalienable right" to consolidate their cultural identity and to "exercise … self-determination." Ethnodevelopment, as described in this Declaration, is the extension and consolidation of the elements of culture, "through strengthening the independent decision-making capacity of a culturally distinct society to direct its own development and exercise self-determination, at whatever level, which implies an equitable and independent share of power. This means that the ethnic group is a political and administrative unit, with authority over its own territory and decision-making powers within the confines of its development project, in a process of increasing autonomy and self-management... "

Due to the indigenous peoples' demands as contained in the Declaration of the earlier 1977 conference and the Martinez Cobo Study's recommendations, the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations was established in 1982 by the UN CRR Sub Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. This body was mandated to review developments concerning indigenous peoples and to develop international standards on indigenous peoples' rights. Since its establishment, indigenous representatives actively engaged with it and fully participated in drafting the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This space provided the opportunity for indigenous peoples to come together not just to make statements but to consolidate their own movement at the global level. We discovered an arena of struggle to further pursue our objectives as movements. While it was clear to us that respect and fulfillment of our rights depended on the strength of our movements locally and nationally, we also knew that linking our struggles at the regional and global levels and getting the international community to adopt an international instrument on our rights would greatly boost our local work.

The World Conferences of the UN in the 1990s also saw the dynamic engagement of indigenous peoples. Our participation in the 1992 Earth Summit (UNCED), for instance, resulted in Chapter 26 of Agenda 21 on "Recognizing and Strengthening the Role of Indigenous Peoples and their Communities," which identified indigenous peoples as a major group that will help bring about sustainable development. At the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, indigenous peoples succeeded in pushing a recommendation for the establishment of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous women took part in the Fourth World Conference on Women and ensured that the final Declaration and Programme of Action contained references on indigenous women. The Asian Indigenous Women's Network, which this writer convened, organized the Indigenous Women's Tent, which became the nerve center of activities for indigenous women and where we agreed on our own "Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women."

Aside from these, some of us started to use the treaty bodies of the UN to air our complaints and issues and to put pressure on member-states to comply with their obligations to international human rights law. Our engagement with the treaty bodies is, in a way, a means to assert that we are equally entitled to enjoy the full protection of international human rights law. To gather more support and get other actors to reinforce our views, we established alliances with various NGOs that work for the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples."

 

Cultural rights and international human rights law

While vibrant debates on economic and social rights and development were taking place, not much was heard around the issue of cultural rights. In fact, culture has been regarded not only as an obstacle to development and modernity, but in the human rights discourse, also as an obstacle to human rights. However, these views are changing because of developments in international human rights law. The adoption of various human rights conventions, which form part of what is now known as International Human Rights Law, has led to substantial debates and jurisprudence on cultural rights, especially as these relate to traditional livelihoods and development of indigenous peoples.

The articles that deal specifically with cultural rights are found in both Articles 27 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights."
Indigenous peoples are among those who contributed in enriching jurisprudence on cultural rights within Treaty Bodies because of the cases they filed with them. Pergus MacKay, a legal expert on indigenous peoples’ rights, who analyzed cases handled by the Human Rights Committee saw jurisprudence emerge on the following rights of indigenous peoples:

To lands, territories and resources traditionally occupied and used and to a   healthy environment:

To protection of sites of cultural and religious significance;

To cultural and physical integrity;

To meaningful participation in decisions that affect them;

To maintain and use their own cultural, social and political institutions;

To be free from discrimination and to equal protection of the law.

 

MacKay also cited HRC's interpretation of Article 27:

 

The HRC has interpreted Article 27 to include the "rights of persons, in community with others, to engage in economic and social activities which are part of the culture of the community to which they belong." In reaching this conclusion, the HRC recognized that indigenous peoples' subsistence and other traditional economic activities are an integral part of their culture, and substantial interference with those activities can be detrimental to their cultural integrity and survival. By necessity, the land, resource base and the environment thereof also require protection if subsistence activities are to be safeguarded. Many of the cases brought by Indigenous peoples under Article 27 challenge state- or corporate-directed resource exploitation. In this context, the HRC has observed that a state's freedom to encourage economic development is limited by the obligations it has assumed under Article 27.

 

The Human Rights Committee issued several General Comments after it made decisions on cases brought before its attention. One of these is General Comment No. 23 (Ibid,53), which recognized that as far as indigenous peoples are concerned " ... culture manifests itself in many forms, including a particular way of life associated with the use of land resources." Cultural right therefore includes the ability to practice traditional livelihoods, such as hunting and gathering and fishing and the right to live in reserves created by law. Thus, the protection of cultural rights ensures the survival of indigenous peoples and the development of their cultural, linguistic and religious identity."

Aside from the HRC landmark decisions, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) of the Organization of American States (OAS) also invoked Article 27 of ICCPR to decide in favor of indigenous peoples." The IACHR declared that "the special legal protections" accorded to Indians for the preservation of their cultural identity should extend to "the aspects linked to productive organization, which includes, among other things, the issues of ancestral and communal lands.”

Because of the numerous cases brought before it by indigenous peoples, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination also came up with General Recommendation XXIII in 1997, which deals specifically with indigenous peoples, culture and identity. It called upon States to:

(e)  Recognize and respect indigenous distinct culture, history, language and way of life as an enrichment of the State's cultural identity and to promote its preservation;

 

(f)   Ensure that members of indigenous peoples are free and equal in dignity and rights and free from any discrimination, in particular that based on indigenous origin and identity;

 

(g)  Provide indigenous peoples with conditions allowing for a sustainable economic and social development compatible with their cultural characteristics;

 

(h) Ensure that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent.

 

(i)  Ensure that indigenous communities can exercise their rights to practice and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs and to preserve and practice their languages.

 

These general comments and recommendations by Treaty Bodies were used extensively by indigenous peoples to bolster their arguments during negotiations of the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In the same vein, during the revision process of the World Bank Operational Manual/Operational Directive 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples (1991) to the newly adopted Operational Policy 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples (2006), they argued that the Bank cannot go below the standards set by International Human Rights Law.

The increasing demands not only by indigenous peoples but also minorities to have their cultural rights recognized and respected have not been ignored by the Commission on Human Rights. For the first time on April 22, 2002 the CHR passed resolution 2002/26 on "Promotion of the enjoyment of cultural rights of everyone and respect for different cultural identities." It affirmed that

each culture has a dignity and value that must be respected and preserved;
 

that every people has the right and duty to develop its culture;
 

that states have the primary responsibility to promote the full enjoyment of cultural rights by everyone and the respect for different cultural identities is vital for the protection of cultural diversity in the context of globalization, and
 

that all peoples have the right of self-determination (Stamatopoulou, 2007: 57).
 

This interpretation further clarifies that the promotion and protection of cultural diversity advances human rights and fundamental freedoms for all which is guaranteed by international human rights law. This reinforces the link between promotion of human rights and cultural diversity.

 

UNESCO universal declaration on cultural diversity      

The UNESCO, the UN agency mainly in charge of matters related to culture, defines cultural rights in "terms of the rights of creators and transmitters of culture, the rights of the people at large to contribute and participate in cultural life and the rights of peoples to cultural integrity" (Stamatopoulou, 2007: 1). It handles many of the substantial discussions around cultural diversity, the relationship between culture and development, and the protection and safeguarding of tangible and intangible cultural heritage. In fact, it has played an important role in the formulation of Article 27 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.

UNESCO has organized various intergovernmental conferences on cultural policies. Among the first was the 1975 Accra Intergovernmental Conference on Cultural Policies in Africa, which was the first intergovernmental process to affirm the principle of incorporating a cultural dimension in development. Another was the 1982 World Conference on Cultural Policies (MONDIACULT) held in Mexico City, which debated the definitions of culture, development and the cultural dimension of development. Its final report defined development as " ... a complex, comprehensive and multidimensional process which extends beyond mere economic growth to incorporate all dimensions of life and all the energies of a community, all of whose
members are called upon to make a contribution and can expect to share in the benefits."

Then in 2001 it adopted the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, which finally mentions indigenous peoples. A landmark declaration, it highlights the link of culture and development and establishes that the guarantee for cultural diversity to flourish is the respect of human rights, but unfortunately it has not gained the attention it merits. It also elaborates how the right to culture establishes an enabling environment for cultural diversity (Article 5), and clarifies that cultural diversity is one of the roots and a factor of development (Article 3) as well as a means to achieve intellectual, moral, emotional and spiritual existence. Furthermore, it stresses that "the defence of cultural diversity is an ethical imperative, inseparable from respect for human dignity" and reifies "cultural pluralism" which should be promoted through intercultural exchange and dialogue. Therefore, a commitment should be made to respect the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples (Article 4).

xxx Overall the Declaration is still a positive development as it signals a shift of UNESCO's views and priorities in its work on culture. Its public image is of a body concerned only with protecting and promoting a concept of culture referred to as "high culture," such as masterpieces of art or literature or historical monuments such as the Greek Parthenon or Egyptian pyramids. It now defines culture in a more holistic manner as seen in Preambular Paragraph 5. Reaffirming that culture should be regarded as the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual, emotional features of society or a social group, and that it encompasses in addition to art and literature, lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs.

Annex 11, containing the main lines of an action plan for its implementation, has among its objectives:

Deepening the international debate on questions relating to cultural diversity. particularly in respect of its links with development and its impact on policy-making at both national and international level: taking forward notably consideration of the advisability of an international legal instrument on cultural diversity.
 

Respecting and protecting traditional knowledge, in particular that of indigenous peoples; recognizing the contribution of traditional knowledge, particularly with regard to environmental protection and the management of natural resources. and fostering synergies between modem science and local knowledge.
